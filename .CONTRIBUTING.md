## Contributing (Solo-PR Workflow)
- Create an issue first (feature/bug/chore).
- Branch from `main`: `feature/<area>-<name>`
- Open a PR into `main`.
- CI must pass before merge.

### Commit Style
Use Conventional Commits:
- feat(scope): ...
- fix(scope): ...
- chore(scope): ...
- docs(scope): ...
- test(scope): ...
